SH_Capacitors.pretty
====================

My personal KiCad footprint collection. These are based on datasheets, random websites, personal experience and anything else I could get my hands on.

Some components (chip resistors, caps, etc) are available with a suffix A, B or C. A meaning "Why don't you take the next bigger part?", B being the one I tend to use most and C stands for "If I could just squeeze that last part in there...".

These suffixes didn't just drop from the sky, some more info can be found here:

Other components (mainly QFN packages) have some specific hacks and work-arounds. An example is the use of through hole pads for thermal vias. Another is the use of pads specifically for stencils.
