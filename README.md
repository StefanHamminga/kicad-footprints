# KiCad footprints overlay

Modified and extra footprints extending the standard library. Most are created by me or modified from the standard library.

## Notes

1. Not all of these comply with the KLC, some by design.
2. These footprints are normally according to the part datasheet and designed for reflow soldering.
3. KiCad team: Feel free to move whichever parts you like to the main repo.
